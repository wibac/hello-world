# hello-world
first repository. Learning to use git-hub.
Something about myself. A software developer with 4 years of experience. Have heard about git-hub but never understood its full potential. After watching the following youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hISp_IK6alI&feature=youtu.be I think this is really useful. Aim is to do one commite each day. Lets do it.
